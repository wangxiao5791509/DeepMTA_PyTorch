# dynamic_global_search_tracker

This is an Officical Implementation of Dynamic Target-aware Viusal Attention Estimation for Viusal Tracking. 

## To do List: 
1. Encoder-decoder framework for global attention estimation; 
2. External memory network to dynamic update the target object; 
3. Integrate with classification based tracker (i.e. RT-MDNet) for final tracking;
